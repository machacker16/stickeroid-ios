Stickeroid is designed to be extremely simple to use, despite the complexity of the algorithms running under the hood. It consists of a set of HTTPS endpoints, when sending requests to these endpoints, set the x-api-key: API_KEY header on your request, replacing API_KEY with your key.

Programmable API made this process really easy to implement for next generation app. Itâ€™s a great value for us because it saved ton of product development time.

Our text-to-sticker solution can translate more than 250,000 word variations with the highest accuracy.
